    In my role at SemGroup, I work as part of a small autonomous team that is responsible for providing quality solutions to primarily internal business customers. I work directly with subject matter experts from within the business throughout the software development lifecycle. We are a Microsoft shop utilizing the .NET stack, and I am very comfortable with the technologies and tools relevant to this stack, including: C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Entity Framework, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, IIS, PowerShell, Active Directory, and others. Many applications include a Web API backend with a single page application framework like Angular for the front end. Depending on requirements, many times a service bus or windows service will be utilized for bulk/extended processing. On a typical project I will gather and refine requirements, and then develop, test, deploy, document, and support the project according to the needs of the customer.
    
    SemGroup was acquired by Energy Transfer Partners in December of 2019.
