title: Hello!

My name is Brian Meek and I am a dev.

This is my little blog. From time to time I might post some things here. This <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> thing is pretty cool. When used with Github pages, it makes getting a little site up really nice and easy! This blog is going to be pretty simple and I plan for it to be a place where I can put down some thoughts. I'm not looking to gain a bunch of followers and change the world, but if I can make my little corner a little lighter and make somebody smile - I'll take it.

Enough about that. A little about me... 

* I have a wife and two kids. Each of them are wonderful and inspiring people.
* I tend to speak in short bursts. 
* I end sentences with prepositions when I speak but try not to when I write. 
* I listen to training videos at 2x speed.
* I don't trust people that have a lot to say.
* I can fall asleep anywhere.
